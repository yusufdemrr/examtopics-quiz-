# Exam Topics Downloader

This repo helps you download all types of exams from https://www.examtopics.com for free.

It also includes a **built-in quiz site** (`frontend/`) that turns any downloaded `.md` file into an interactive practice exam — with answer reveal, score tracking, and multi-exam support. Deploy it to Netlify in one click.

🌐 **Live demo:** [examtopics-quiz.netlify.app](https://examtopics-quiz.netlify.app)

> Originally forked from [thatonecodes/examtopics-downloader](https://github.com/thatonecodes/examtopics-downloader)

## Quiz Site

After downloading an exam, run:

```bash
node generate-manifest.js
```

This copies your `.md` files into `frontend/` and updates the exam list. Then deploy the `frontend/` folder to [Netlify](https://netlify.com) (drag & drop).

**Netlify auto-deploy settings:**
| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Build command | `node generate-manifest.js` |
| Publish directory | `frontend` |

## Setting it Up

### Using docker

1. Make sure [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) is installed on your system.
2. Pull the docker image:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/thatonecodes/examtopics-downloader:latest
```

3\. Run the container:

```bash

  --name examtopics-downloader \
  ghcr.io/thatonecodes/examtopics-downloader:latest \
  -p google -s devops \
  -save-links -o output.md
docker cp examtopics-downloader:/app/output.md .
docker cp examtopics-downloader:/app/saved-links.txt .
docker rm examtopics-downloader
```

> [!NOTE]  
> If seeing `exec: format exec error` or warnings about unsuportted platforms, if you are on `linux/arm64`, modify the docker cmd to:

```bash
docker run -it \
  --name examtopics-downloader \

### `-save-links` && `-output-save-links`

This is a bool flag, so the default is that it's set to `false`, deactivated. If `-save-links` is false `-output-save-links` will do nothing.
`-output-save-links` is a `string` which includes the output path for the saved links, default is `saved-links.txt`.

### Grep String, `-s`

The `-s` argument can take an exam ID (ex. 200-301) or a word, such as "devops". for example:

```bash
go run . -p google -s devops
```

would get all exams from the `google` provider containing the string `devops`.

### Comments and output, `-c` && `-o`

The `-c` argument is another bool flag, so it is defaultly set to false(as it creates a lot of noise in the `.md` file), but you can include it by adding the flag.
`-o` is the output path, based on `os.create(path)`, in the current working directory.

### Exams output, `-exams`

This argument will display output defaulted to such as and exit immediately.

### Token Input, `-t`

When you add you `Github` PAT, it allows for more requests to the API, (up to 5000) which is needed when scraping bigger things.
The cached data helps you access big dumps faster.

### No Cache Arg, `-no-cache`

When you add this argument, it tells the program to ignore the cached `Github` repoitories of updated exam info, however the scraper will take longer than the cache.
Useful when wanting to scrape realtime data.

### File Type, `-type`

When you use the `-type` argument, it tells the program to convert the default filetype of `.md` files to the option of your choice.  
Currently we have these types supported:  
- `html` -> generates `examtopics_output.html`
- `pdf` -> generates `examtopics_output.pdf`
- `txt` -> generates `examtopics_output.txt`

> [!NOTE]  
> Files are kept in same/similar format as you would see in the `.md` file, for formatting changes, use other arguments.

## [For outputted file examples, see the examples folder](examples/google_devops.md)

## Demo

So, you have installed `go` on your system, and you're inside of the working directory. Let's say you would like the questions for the cisco exam 200-301.

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
go run . -p cisco -s 200-301
```

Note that you can put the id as the string to look for, as the program is compatible this way also.

After waiting a few moments, you would see the output end with:

```bash
Successfully saved output to {OUTPUT_LOCATION}.
```

If so, hooray, you have successfully saved all/most of the questions in a `.md` file!
The format would be such as (older, only scraping format):
