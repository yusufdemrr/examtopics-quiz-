These patterns consist of Amazon EC2 instances, Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) load balancers, Amazon RDS databases, and Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) clusters or Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) clusters.Currently, the company’s developers can create their own CloudFormation stacks to increase the overall speed of delivery. A centralized CI/CD pipeline in a shared services AWS account deploys each CloudFormation stack.The company's security team has already provided requirements for each service in accordance with internal standards. If there are any resources that do not comply with the internal standards, the security team must receive notification to take appropriate action. The security team must implement a notification solution that gives developers the ability to maintain the same overall delivery speed that they currently have.Which solution will meet these requirements in the MOST operationally efficient way? 
Suggested Answer: B 🗳️ 

A. Create an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic. Subscribe the security team's email addresses to the SNS topic. Create a custom AWS Lambda function that will run the aws cloudformation validate-template AWS CLI command on all CloudFormation templates before the build stage in the CI/CD pipeline. Configure the CI/CD pipeline to publish a notification to the SNS topic if any issues are found.

B. Create an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic. Subscribe the security team's email addresses to the SNS topic. Create custom rules in CloudFormation Guard for each resource configuration. In the CI/CD pipeline, before the build stage, configure a Docker image to run the cfn-guard command on the CloudFormation template. Configure the CI/CD pipeline to publish a notification to the SNS topic if any issues are found.

C. Create an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic and an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Subscribe the security team's email addresses to the SNS topic. Create an Amazon S3 bucket in the shared services AWS account. Include an event notification to publish to the SQS queue when new objects are added to the S3 bucket. Require the developers to put their CloudFormation templates in the S3 bucket. Launch EC2 instances that automatically scale based on the SQS queue depth. Configure the EC2 instances to use CloudFormation Guard to scan the templates and deploy the templates if there are no issues. Configure the CI/CD pipeline to publish a notification to the SNS topic if any issues are found.

D. Create a centralized CloudFormation stack set that includes a standard set of resources that the developers can deploy in each AWS account. Configure each CloudFormation template to meet the security requirements.

[All AWS Certified Security - Specialty SCS-C02 Questions]

A company runs workloads that are spread across hundreds of Amazon EC2 instances. During a recent security incident, an EC2 instance was compromised and ran malware code until the company manually terminated the instance.The company is now using Amazon GuardDuty to detect malware on EC2 instances. A security engineer needs to implement a solution that automates a response when GuardDuty determines that an instance is infected. The solution must mitigate the incident and must comply with the AWS Well-Architected Framework guidance for incident response.Which solution will meet these requirements? 
Suggested Answer: C 🗳️ 

A. Configure AWS Systems Manager Run Command to run when a GuardDuty scan determines that an instance is infected. Use Run Command to remove all network adapters from the operating system of the infected instance. Use Run Command to also add a tag of “Infected” to the instance.

B. Create an AWS Lambda function that runs when a GuardDuty scan determines that an instance is infected. Program the Lambda function to delete all elastic network interfaces that are associated with the instance. Program the Lambda function to also add a tag of “Infected” to the instance.

C. Create an AWS Lambda function that runs when a GuardDuty scan determines that an instance is infected. Program the Lambda function to detach all Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes from the instance. Program the Lambda function to also add a tag of “Infected” to the EBS volumes and to terminate the instance afterward.

D. Define a separate VPC to isolate EC2 instances. Define a security group that does not allow any network traffic.

[All AWS Certified Security - Specialty SCS-C02 Questions]

A company's security engineer is designing an isolation procedure for Amazon EC2 instances as part of an incident response plan. The security engineer needs to isolate a target instance to block any traffic to and from the target instance, except for traffic from the company's forensics team. Each of the company's EC2 instances has its own dedicated security group. The EC2 instances are deployed in subnets of a VPC. A subnet can contain multiple instances.The security engineer is testing the procedure for EC2 isolation and opens an SSH session to the target instance. The procedure starts to simulate access to the target instance by an attacker. The security engineer removes the existing security group rules and adds security group rules to give the forensics team access to the target instance on port 22.After these changes, the security engineer notices that the SSH connection is still active and usable. When the security engineer runs a ping command to the public IP address of the target instance, the ping command is blocked.What should the security engineer do to isolate the target instance? 
Suggested Answer: B 🗳️ 

A. Add an inbound rule to the security group to allow traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 for all ports. Add an outbound rule to the security group to allow traffic to 0.0.0.0/0 for all ports. Then immediately delete these rules.

B. Remove the port 22 security group rule. Attach an instance role policy that allows AWS Systems Manager Session Manager connections so that the forensics team can access the target instance.

C. Create a network ACL that is associated with the target instance's subnet. Add a rule at the top of the inbound rule set to deny all traffic from 0.0.0.0/0. Add a rule at the top of the outbound rule set to deny all traffic to 0.0.0.0/0.

D. Create an AWS Systems Manager document that adds a host-level firewall rule to block all inbound traffic and outbound traffic. Run the document on the target instance.

The company allows only a centralized security team to create IAM roles for all AWS accounts and teams. Application teams submit requests for IAM roles to the security team. The security team has a backlog of IAM role requests and cannot review and provision the IAM roles quickly.The security team must create a process that will allow application teams to provision their own IAM roles. The process must also limit the scope of IAM roles and prevent privilege escalation.Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead? 
Suggested Answer: D 🗳️ 

A. Create an IAM group for each application team. Associate policies with each IAM group. Provision IAM users for each application team member. Add the new IAM users to the appropriate IAM group by using role-based access control (RBAC).

B. Delegate application team leads to provision IAM roles for each team. Conduct a quarterly review of the IAM roles the team leads have provisioned. Ensure that the application team leads have the appropriate training to review IAM roles.

A security engineer receives a notice about suspicious activity from a Linux-based Amazon EC2 instance that uses Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS)-based storage. The instance is making connections to known malicious addresses.The instance is in a development account within a VPC that is in the us-east-1 Region. The VPC contains an internet gateway and has a subnet in us-east-1a and us-east-1b. Each subnet is associate with a route table that uses the internet gateway as a default route. Each subnet also uses the default network ACL. The suspicious EC2 instance runs within the us-east-1b subnet. During an initial investigation, a security engineer discovers that the suspicious instance is the only instance that runs in the subnet.Which response will immediately mitigate the attack and help investigate the root cause? 
Suggested Answer: B 🗳️ 

A. Log in to the suspicious instance and use the netstat command to identify remote connections. Use the IP addresses from these remote connections to create deny rules in the security group of the instance. Install diagnostic tools on the instance for investigation. Update the outbound network ACL for the subnet in us-east-1b to explicitly deny all connections as the first rule during the investigation of the instance.

B. Update the outbound network ACL for the subnet in us-east-1 b to explicitly deny all connections as the first rule. Replace the security group with a new security group that allows connections only from a diagnostics security group. Update the outbound network ACL for the us-east-1 b subnet to remove the deny all rule. Launch a new EC2 instance that has diagnostic tools. Assign the new security group to the new EC2 instance. Use the new EC2 instance to investigate the suspicious instance.

C. Ensure that the Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes that are attached to the suspicious EC2 instance will not delete upon termination. Terminate the instance. Launch a new EC2 instance in us-east-1a that has diagnostic tools. Mount the EBS volumes from the terminated instance for investigation.

D. Create an AWS WAF web ACL that denies traffic to and from the suspicious instance. Attach the AWS WAF web ACL to the instance to mitigate the attack. Log in to the instance and install diagnostic tools to investigate the instance.

B. Create a script to export a .csv file from the AWS Trusted Advisor check for IAM access key rotation. Load the script into an AWS Lambda function that will upload the .csv file to an Amazon S3 bucket. Create an Amazon Athena table query that runs when the .csv file is uploaded to the S3 bucket. Publish the results for any keys older than 90 days by using an invocation of an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) notification to the security team.

C. Create a script to download the IAM credentials report on a periodic basis. Load the script into an AWS Lambda function that will run on a schedule through Amazon EventBridge. Configure the Lambda script to load the report into memory and to filter the report for records in which the key was last rotated at least 90 days ago. If any records are detected, send an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) notification to the security team.

D. Create an AWS Lambda function that queries the IAM API to list all the users. Iterate through the users by using the ListAccessKeys operation. Verify that the value in the CreateDate field is not at least 90 days old. Send an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) notification to the security team if the value is at least 90 days old.
