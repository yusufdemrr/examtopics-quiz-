Question #: 147
Topic #: 1

[All AWS Certified Machine Learning - Specialty Questions]

A manufacturing company uses machine learning (ML) models to detect quality issues. The models use images that are taken of the company's product at the end of each production step. The company has thousands of machines at the production site that generate one image per second on average.The company ran a successful pilot with a single manufacturing machine. For the pilot, ML specialists used an industrial PC that ran AWS IoT Greengrass with a long-running AWS Lambda function that uploaded the images to Amazon S3. The uploaded images invoked a Lambda function that was written in Python to perform inference by using an Amazon SageMaker endpoint that ran a custom model. The inference results were forwarded back to a web service that was hosted at the production site to prevent faulty products from being shipped.The company scaled the solution out to all manufacturing machines by installing similarly configured industrial PCs on each production machine. However, latency for predictions increased beyond acceptable limits. Analysis shows that the internet connection is at its capacity limit.How can the company resolve this issue MOST cost-effectively? 
Suggested Answer: D 🗳️ 

A. Set up a 10 Gbps AWS Direct Connect connection between the production site and the nearest AWS Region. Use the Direct Connect connection to upload the images. Increase the size of the instances and the number of instances that are used by the SageMaker endpoint.

B. Extend the long-running Lambda function that runs on AWS IoT Greengrass to compress the images and upload the compressed files to Amazon S3. Decompress the files by using a separate Lambda function that invokes the existing Lambda function to run the inference pipeline.

C. Use auto scaling for SageMaker. Set up an AWS Direct Connect connection between the production site and the nearest AWS Region. Use the Direct Connect connection to upload the images.

D. Deploy the Lambda function and the ML models onto the AWS IoT Greengrass core that is running on the industrial PCs that are installed on each machine. Extend the long-running Lambda function that runs on AWS IoT Greengrass to invoke the Lambda function with the captured images and run the inference on the edge component that forwards the results directly to the web service.

A data scientist is working on a forecast problem by using a dataset that consists of .csv files that are stored in Amazon S3. The files contain a timestamp variable in the following format:March 1st, 2020, 08:14pm -There is a hypothesis about seasonal differences in the dependent variable. This number could be higher or lower for weekdays because some days and hours present varying values, so the day of the week, month, or hour could be an important factor. As a result, the data scientist needs to transform the timestamp into weekdays, month, and day as three separate variables to conduct an analysis.Which solution requires the LEAST operational overhead to create a new dataset with the added features? 
Suggested Answer: C 🗳️ 

A. Create an Amazon EMR cluster. Develop PySpark code that can read the timestamp variable as a string, transform and create the new variables, and save the dataset as a new file in Amazon S3.

B. Create a processing job in Amazon SageMaker. Develop Python code that can read the timestamp variable as a string, transform and create the new variables, and save the dataset as a new file in Amazon S3.

C. Create a new flow in Amazon SageMaker Data Wrangler. Import the S3 file, use the Featurize date/time transform to generate the new variables, and save the dataset as a new file in Amazon S3.

Topic #: 1

[All AWS Certified Machine Learning - Specialty Questions]

A news company is developing an article search tool for its editors. The search tool should look for the articles that are most relevant and representative for particular words that are queried among a corpus of historical news documents.The editors test the first version of the tool and report that the tool seems to look for word matches in general. The editors have to spend additional time to filter the results to look for the articles where the queried words are most important. A group of data scientists must redesign the tool so that it isolates the most frequently used words in a document. The tool also must capture the relevance and importance of words for each document in the corpus.Which solution meets these requirements? 
Suggested Answer: B 🗳️ 

A. Extract the topics from each article by using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling. Create a topic table by assigning the sum of the topic counts as a score for each word in the articles. Configure the tool to retrieve the articles where this topic count score is higher for the queried words.

B. Build a term frequency for each word in the articles that is weighted with the article's length. Build an inverse document frequency for each word that is weighted with all articles in the corpus. Define a final highlight score as the product of both of these frequencies. Configure the tool to retrieve the articles where this highlight score is higher for the queried words.

C. Download a pretrained word-embedding lookup table. Create a titles-embedding table by averaging the title's word embedding for each article in the corpus. Define a highlight score for each word as inversely proportional to the distance between its embedding and the title embedding. Configure the tool to retrieve the articles where this highlight score is higher for the queried words.

D. Build a term frequency score table for each word in each article of the corpus. Assign a score of zero to all stop words. For any other words, assign a score as the word’s frequency in the article. Configure the tool to retrieve the articles where this frequency score is higher for the queried words.
