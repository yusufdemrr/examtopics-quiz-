The pipeline also includes EMR jobs that load the data to Amazon Redshift.The company's cloud infrastructure team manually built a Step Functions state machine. The cloud infrastructure team launched an EMR cluster into a VPC to support the EMR jobs. However, the deployed Step Functions state machine is not able to run the EMR jobs.Which combination of steps should the company take to identify the reason the Step Functions state machine is not able to run the EMR jobs? (Choose two.) 
Suggested Answer: BD 🗳️ 

A. Use AWS CloudFormation to automate the Step Functions state machine deployment. Create a step to pause the state machine during the EMR jobs that fail. Configure the step to wait for a human user to send approval through an email message. Include details of the EMR task in the email message for further analysis.

B. Verify that the Step Functions state machine code has all IAM permissions that are necessary to create and run the EMR jobs. Verify that the Step Functions state machine code also includes IAM permissions to access the Amazon S3 buckets that the EMR jobs use. Use Access Analyzer for S3 to check the S3 access properties.

C. Check for entries in Amazon CloudWatch for the newly created EMR cluster. Change the AWS Step Functions state machine code to use Amazon EMR on EKS. Change the IAM access policies and the security group configuration for the Step Functions state machine code to reflect inclusion of Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS).

D. Query the flow logs for the VPC. Determine whether the traffic that originates from the EMR cluster can successfully reach the data providers. Determine whether any security group that might be attached to the Amazon EMR cluster allows connections to the data source servers on the informed ports.

E. Check the retry scenarios that the company configured for the EMR jobs. Increase the number of seconds in the interval between each EMR task. Validate that each fallback state has the appropriate catch for each decision state. Configure an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic to store the error messages.

A. Change the Firehose output format to Apache Parquet. Provide a custom S3 object YYYYMMDD prefix expression and specify a large buffer size. For the existing data, create an AWS Glue extract, transform, and load (ETL) job. Configure the ETL job to combine small JSON files, convert the JSON files to large Parquet files, and add the YYYYMMDD prefix. Use the ALTER TABLE ADD PARTITION statement to reflect the partition on the existing Athena table.

B. Create an Apache Spark job that combines JSON files and converts the JSON files to Apache Parquet files. Launch an Amazon EMR ephemeral cluster every day to run the Spark job to create new Parquet files in a different S3 location. Use the ALTER TABLE SET LOCATION statement to reflect the new S3 location on the existing Athena table.

C. Create a Kinesis data stream as a delivery destination for Firehose. Use Amazon Managed Service for Apache Flink (previously known as Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics) to run Apache Flink on the Kinesis data stream. Use Flink to aggregate the data and save the data to Amazon S3 in Apache Parquet format with a custom S3 object YYYYMMDD prefix. Use the ALTER TABLE ADD PARTITION statement to reflect the partition on the existing Athena table.

D. Integrate an AWS Lambda function with Firehose to convert source records to Apache Parquet and write them to Amazon S3. In parallel, run an AWS Glue extract, transform, and load (ETL) job to combine the JSON files and convert the JSON files to large Parquet files. Create a custom S3 object YYYYMMDD prefix. Use the ALTER TABLE ADD PARTITION statement to reflect the partition on the existing Athena table.

The company uses an AWS Glue extract, transform, and load (ETL) pipeline to look for outliers in the data from the stream. When the workflow detects an outlier, it sends a notification to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic. The SNS topic initiates a second workflow to retrieve logs for the outliers and stores the logs in an Amazon S3 bucket.The company experiences delays in the notifications to the SNS topic during periods when the data stream is processing a high volume of data. When the company examines Amazon CloudWatch logs, the company notices a high value for the glue.driver.BlockManager.disk.diskSpaceUsed_MB metric when the traffic is high. The company must resolve this issue.Which solution will meet this requirement with the LEAST operational effort? 
Suggested Answer: D 🗳️ 

A. Increase the number of data processing units (DPUs) in AWS Glue ETL jobs.

B. Use Amazon EMR to manage the ETL pipeline instead of AWS Glue.

C. Use AWS Step Functions to orchestrate a parallel workflow state.

D. Enable auto scaling for the AWS Glue ETL jobs.
